# "7Hz Salnotes Zero" personal frequency response calculations

I don't know what's wrong with mine, their frequency response is not even close to what is posted on autoeq.app or squig.link (I realized that when equalizers from these sites didn't give a positive effect for me.)

So I measured them myself using the BOYA BY-M1S, Room EQ Wizard (REW) and a metal tube to simulate the ear canal :D

(You can doubt the quality of these calculations, I wonâ€™t object, but this peak... this peak I can hear well with my own ears. The whole idea was to find frequency of this particular peak.)
