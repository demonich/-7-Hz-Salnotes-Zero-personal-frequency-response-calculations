# "7Hz Salnotes Zero" personal frequency response calculations
I don't know what's wrong with mine, their frequency response is not even close to what is posted on autoeq.app or squig.link
So I measured them myself using the BOYA BY-M1S, Room EQ Wizard (REW) and a metal tube to simulate the ear canal :D
